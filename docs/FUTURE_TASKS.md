# FUTURE_TASKS

## Harder Tasks for Future Work

### 1. Experiment with Different Drafting Strategies
- **Task**: Simulate and evaluate various drafting strategies.
- **Details**:
  - Prioritize safety vs. upside.
  - Test strategies like "zero RB" or "early QB."
- **Outcome**: Insights into the effectiveness of different strategies.

### 2. Add Bench Players to the Draft
- **Task**: Incorporate bench players into the draft simulation.
- **Details**:
  - Update draft logic to include bench spots.
  - Adjust scoring to account for bench contributions.
  - As part of this, adjust optimization to not just look at maximizing team score, but also minimizing other teams' scores
- **Outcome**: More realistic draft simulations and to see where the value is for taking backup QB's

### 3. Bake in Risk (Injury and Underperformance)
- **Task**: Add risk metrics to player evaluations.
- **Details**:
  - Use historical data to calculate injury and underperformance risks.
  - Adjust VBR and ADP calculations to account for risk.
- **Outcome**: Draft strategies that balance value and risk.
